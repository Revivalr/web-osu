            <h3>4/29/2021 | 8:44pm - Thanks QuiteAFancyEmerald For including me on his game roster for his unblocker! PS: We have a domain now!</h3>
            Today, I both purchased and setup the <a href="https://webosu.online">new domain</a> for owu! as well as QuiteAFancyEmerald added this site onto the holyunblocker games section!<br>
            Other than that theres nothing different with the code other than some grammar changes! Just thought it deserved an announcement<br><br>
            - New Domain link: https://webosu.online/<br><br>

            <h3>4/25/2021 | 5:36am - Arc.io CDN</h3>
            Because I couldn't do anything with the Live Plays idea I atleast tried to do something useful, so I
            implemented Arc.io CDN.
            Basically what it does is it makes your exxperience faster and makes me some money! Its a win-win. Thats it
            from me.<br><br>
            <h4>Updates</h4>
            - Arc CDN Integrated<br><br>

            <h3>4/25/2021 5:10am - Live Plays</h3>
            So, I was going to make a live plays section but, I have a limited hosting capabilities
            at the time being and it seems impossible from a technical standpoint, at some point I'd like to set up a
            server for this site
            and buy subdomains/domains to run a custom API but right now its just not happening, I'll add a donation
            link sometime tomorrow
            anything going to that would be put *directly* into funds for bettering the site.<br>
            As for changes, there is none, thanks for checking the changelog!<br><br>

            <h3>4/24/2021 - Initial Log entry and some updates</h3>
            First off this is *the* very first changelog entry consider yourself cool if you see it<br>
            Second off, this started as a little project to keep me busy when I saw it posted on github in chinese and a
            shitty theme
            so, I imported and got to work now its a project I plan to uphold for a while.<br><br>
            <h4>Updates</h4>
            - Fixed "Load More" buttons and the sort tab, lol<br>
            - Edited the theme a little, I think it looks good now<br><br>
